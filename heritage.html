<h1>Discovering the Heritage of India:</h1><br>


<p>1.Nalanda University: Located in the town of Rajgir [ancient Imperial capital city] in the northern province of Bihar in India, Nalanda University is a post-graduate, research-intensive international university established on 25th November 2010, as “an institution of national importance”, by a special Act [No. 39 of 2010] of the Parliament of India, aiming to revive the erstwhile renowned ancient seat of learning, which thrived from 5th century CE to 12th century CE, as the first residential university of the world.

    The rejuvenation of ancient Nalanda was proposed by former President Late Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam. The member states attending the East Asia Summits [Cebu, 2007 and Hua Hin, 2009], also sought the revival of the ancient Nalanda to “improve regional understanding and appreciation of one another’s heritage and history; to strengthen regional educational cooperation; and to build a community of learning which symbolises the spirituality that unites all mankind.” Other countries of the world have also signed intergovernmental memoranda of understanding to support the Nalanda University.</p>

<p>2.Hampi temple: Hampi was a fortified city and the capital of the Vijayanagara empire in the 14th century. Hampi in 1500 CE had the glory of being the world’s second largest city after Beijing. It was a flourishing city, drawing traders from Persia and Portugal. It has been recorded in the chronicles by the Persian, European travellers, particularly the Portuguese that Hampi on the banks of the Tungabhadra river in those days spelt prosperity with many temples, farms and trade markets.

    The monuments of the Vijayanagara city were constructed between 1336-1570 AD from the times of Harihara-I to Sadasiva Raya. Krishnadevaraya also contributed in the way of royal buildings from 1509 to 30 AD. The structures boast of Dravidian architecture. However, in 1565, the muslim sultanates conquered Hampi and brought its ruin. Though the place is pillaged and is in ruins, the beautiful natural setting of Hampi, which comprises the River Tungabhadra and the boulders are on this day.</p>

<p>3.Taj Mahal: The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
    
    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</p>

<p>4. Hawa Mahal: The Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic attractions of the city. The five-storey building looks like a honeycomb of a beehive and it is always windy inside, owing to the numerous windows and jharokhas. This amazing ventilation that the palace enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which literally translates into the “Palace of the Winds”.


    The main purpose behind the construction of this palace was to allow the ladies of the royal family and the court to observe the busy streets of the Johari Bazaar from the many jharokhas of the palace, without being seen themselves. The Hawa Mahal is a five-storey building, and it is the tallest building in the world that has been built without a foundation. It has a curved architecture that leans at an 87 degree angle, and a pyramidal shape which has helped it stay erect for c</p>

<p>5. Ajanta Caves: The caves at Ajanta are excavated out of a vertical cliff above the left bank of the river Waghora in the hills of Ajanta. They are thirty in number, including the unfinished ones, of which five (caves 9, 10, 19, 26 and 29) are chaityagrihas (sanctuary) and the rest, sangharamas or viharas (monastery). The caves are connected with the river by rock-cut staircases. The excavation activity was carried out in two different phases separated by an interval of about four centuries. The first phase coincides with the rule of the Satavahana dynasty from about the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE, while the second phase corresponds to the Basim branch of the Vakataka dynasty with their Asmaka and Rishika feudatories in the 5th to 6th centuries CE.

    Altogether, six caves (caves 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15A) were excavated in the first phase by Hinayana/Theravadin followers of Buddhism, wherein Buddha was worshipped in an aniconic/symbolic form. These caves are simple and austere, and carry mural paintings sparsely. The chaityagrihas are characterized by a vaulted ceiling and an apsidal end, the façade dominated by a horseshoe-shaped window, known as chaitya window. Internally, they are divided by colonnades into a central nave and side aisles, the latter continuing behind the apse for circumambulation. At the centre of the apse stands the object of worship in the form of a chaitya or stupa, also hewn out of the rock. The monasteries consist of an astylar hall meant for congregation, and range of cells on three sides serving as the dwelling-apartments (viharas) for monks.</p>

<p>6.Konark Sun Temole: The Konark Sun Temple, located in the town of Konark in the Indian state of Odisha, is a magnificent architectural marvel and UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is dedicated to the Hindu Sun God, Surya, and is renowned for its intricate carvings, breathtaking architecture, and unique design, which resembles a colossal chariot carrying the Sun God across the heavens.

    Built in the 13th century by King Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, the Konark Temple stands as a testament to the rich cultural heritage and architectural brilliance of ancient India. The temple's name, "Konark," is derived from the Sanskrit words "Kona" (corner) and "Arka" (Sun), signifying its location on the eastern corner of the Odisha coastline, where the first rays of the rising sun illuminate the temple's facade.
    
    The architectural style of the Konark Temple is a harmonious blend of Kalinga (Odisha) and Dravidian architectural elements, with influences from indigenous Odishan temple architecture. The main sanctum, or "garbhagriha," which once housed a colossal image of the Sun God, is now in ruins. However, the temple's intricate carvings and ornate sculptures continue to captivate visitors with their beauty and craftsmanship.
    
    The most iconic feature of the Konark Temple is its chariot-shaped design, which is intricately carved with depictions of celestial beings, mythical creatures, floral motifs, and scenes from Hindu mythology. The temple's main structure is supported by twelve elaborately carved stone wheels, each representing a month of the year and serving as sundials to track time accurately.
    
    The Konark Temple is also famous for its erotic sculptures, which adorn the walls and pillars of the temple complex. These sculptures, depicting various aspects of human life and passion, are masterfully executed and serve as a reflection of the broader Indian cultural ethos regarding love, desire, and the cycle of life.
    
    In addition to its architectural splendor, the Konark Temple is of great religious significance to Hindus, who regard it as a sacred pilgrimage site dedicated to the Sun God. The temple attracts devotees and tourists from all over the world, who come to marvel at its beauty, soak in its spiritual ambiance, and pay homage to one of the most revered deities in Hinduism.
    
    Despite the passage of centuries and the ravages of time, the Konark Sun Temple remains a timeless symbol of India's rich cultural heritage and architectural prowess. Its grandeur and beauty continue to inspire awe and wonder, making it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in exploring the vibrant tapestry of Indian history and culture..</p>
